# Blockchain Multi-Network Interaction Project

This project demonstrates interactions with blockchain networks and supports multi-network synchronization for various smart contracts. It also features decentralized file storage and includes all the components needed for efficient blockchain development. 

## Features
- **ERC721 Solidity Contract**: This contract has been modified to integrate with platforms like OpenSea.
- **Multi-Network Interaction Code**: Handles synchronous communication between multiple blockchain networks and the deployed contracts.
- **IPFS Interaction Code**: Facilitates decentralized file storage using the IPFS protocol.
- **Pinata Key Generator**: Provides a secure method for generating API keys for Pinata, a popular IPFS service.
